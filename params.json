{"name":"Support","tagline":"Support for games released by The Mad Bug","body":"## Welcome to The Mad Bug Games\r\n\r\n* Important, this is just the support site. The code for the game is not currently open source, and the games can be found on iTunes.\r\n\r\n## Dino Time\r\nDino Time is a short iPhone game inspired by some arcade classics. Have your time traveller knock down some dino nest eggs into the dino egg carrier trucks.\r\nUnsurprisingly, dinos like to eat time travellers, but are known to slip on (or be squished by) falling nests.\r\nFlares that will stun dinos appear from time to time.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\nThe only control is swiping in the direction you want to move. If you leave your finger on the screen you can swipe in several directions in advance.\r\nQuickly tapping the screen will make your time traveler stop.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
