## Dino Time

Dino Time is a short iPhone game inspired by some arcade classics. Have your time traveller knock down some dino nest eggs into the dino egg carrier trucks. Unsurprisingly, dinos like to eat time travellers, but are known to slip on (or be squished by) falling nests. Flares that will stun dinos appear from time to time.

### Controls

The only control is swiping in the direction you want to move. If you leave your finger on the screen you can swipe in several directions in advance. Quickly tapping the screen will make your time traveler stop.
